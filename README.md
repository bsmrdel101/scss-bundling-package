# SCSS-Bundling

Watches for changes in your styles directory and generates a `bundle.scss` file that imports all your scss files into it. All you need to do manually is import the `bundle.scss` file.

## Commands
```bash
  scss-bundling watch   # watch and auto-update bundle.scss
  scss-bundling build   # generate bundle.scss once
```
